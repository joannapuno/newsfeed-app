***Welcome to QUACK It! App**

***Here are the current functionalities you can do with the App:**

Top Navigation
- Toggle Side Drawer Icon
    - Switch to Dark Mode

Add Button
- Add Text, Image, or Both

Added Card
- Like (Heart Button)

Clicking Backdrop
- Close Side Drawer
- Close Add Post Input Field

***Some things I’ve noticed that I’d like to fix:**
- Add Button “+” icon not vertically entered on Safari browsers
- At times, the Dark Mode toggle gets “un-toggled”. I haven’t been able to re-create this bug, but if you do, please let me know the steps you did to re-create it.
